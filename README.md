# TopOptTools
This is a series of tools developed from scratch in Julia both as a learning method as well as functional use for the MIT class 1.583: Topology Optimization of Structures taken in Fall 2020. The main goal of this repository is for me to learn best-practices for coding, both in the language itself (taking full advantage of multiple dispatch and data structures), as well as properly documenting, version-controlling, and maintaining a code base.
